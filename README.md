# Resume Builder Prototype

A small, client-side resume builder prototype using React + Vite. It provides:

- Live form editor and preview.
- Two open-source-inspired templates (Modern, Classic).
- Import/export JSON for portability.
- Print-friendly output (use browser Print to create PDF).

How to run

```pwsh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the dev URL printed by Vite. Use the editor on the left to edit your resume, switch templates, export JSON, or press Print (or use browser Print to save PDF).

Notes

- This is a minimal prototype meant to be extended. Suggested next steps: add more templates, LinkedIn import, PDF generation via html2pdf or server-side rendering, and accessible controls.
